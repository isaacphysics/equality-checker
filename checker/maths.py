       Returns a dict describing the equality; with important keys being 'equal',

       this should always be checked for first.

        - 'test_str' should be the untrusted string for sympy to parse.
        - 'target_str' should be the trusted string to parse and match against.
        - 'symbols' should be a string list or comma separated string of symbols
           not to split during parsing.
        - 'check_symbols' indicates whether to verfiy the symbols used in each
          expression are exactly the same or not; setting this to False will
          allow symbols which cancel out to be included (probably don't want this
          in questions).
        - 'description' is an optional description to print before the checker's
          output to stdout which can be used to improve logging.
